    "Seasonal influenza outbreaks of influenza are a frequent threat to public health. Circulating viruses cause disease in domestic and wild animals. Viral mutations in wild species are a source of zoonotic diseases, and pandemics such as the Influenza outbreak of 1918 and the H3N2 outbreak of 2009 [1]. While outbreaks circulate seasonally, there are periodic pandemics that lead to high rates of hospitalization and unexpectedly high mortality [2].\n",

    "Influenza A is the only known cause of pandemic outbreaks, with swine and avian strains representing important sources of novel strains causing severe disease in humans [1, 2]. As such, monitoring future outbreaks requires not only observation of seasonal trends in humans, but also monitoring  of animal population healthing [3]. \n",

    "The United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) offers a tools to view nationally-pooled data for mortality, hospitalization, virologic surveillance data. For this exercise, I queried the CDC's FluView tool to examine data for the subtypes of Influenza A and Influenza B aggregated by season and age group. The most recent data at the time of query included the 2022-2023 flu season. My interest was in subtype and lineage characteristics in the two types of Influenza capable of circulating in humans, type A and type B. As such, I chose to include a wide time range. Because I was interested in changes in subtype between years, I chose a 25 year timespan minimally so that visualizations included at least 2 decades and to better illustrate the emergence of the 2009 pandemic compared to earlier decades. During the query, I also included all categories of Influenza A and B subtypes and lineages respectively, as well as each age group category. After the query, the raw data was saved as a CSV file for later use. \n",

Additionally, early visualizations of flu subtypes by season were visually confusing with the seasons labelled as ranges on a graph. In the interest of making comprehensible visualizations, I used a regular expression to remove the end date of the range. Furthermore, I converted the 'Season' column to period after converting to date time.
